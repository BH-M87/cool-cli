# cool-cli
----
## Install  
`npm install cool-cli`

## What?
A cool cli, with independent webpack config, for building app in a simple way.

## Why?
We usually put our webpack configuration in our own project with popular project generator. After hundreds of projects, we config or update the webpack configuration hundreds of times. So I want to do it in a simple and cool way. Seperate all the webpack configutation out of the project, nothing to worry about webpack config anymore.

## How?
1. First, support `npm start` and `npm run build`. Used for dev and prod environment.
2. Besides basic configuration, import `happypack` to improve building speed.
3. Other optimization.
